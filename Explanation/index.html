			<p class="sectionHeading" id="part1-backstory"><b><a href="nolinkpart1-backstory">Part 1:</a></b> personal issues, the origin of FNAW</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>Apart from bad mental health, the first important thing that happened that put all these events into motion was the class I was in throughout my 3 years of middle school
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>My middle school, <b>which is the school featured in the game</b>, had this special program they referred to as "summa". It is a program they have for kids the teachers think are smarter than everyone else, where they created a special class in every grade with 30 of the kids in it who they think are the smartest kids in the grade who have the best chance of succeeding in life. The idea appeared to be to shield us from the less 'smart' kids in the school to in some way make it easier for us to learn without distractions.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b>I became stuck in a class with the same 30 kids in it for 3 out of 5 periods a day for the entire 3 solid years we were in middle school,</b> without anyone new joining or leaving. This meant that we (the class) were together for about 4 to 5 hours a day with no breaks except lunch and electives.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b>I had my two 'best' friends in these classes,</b> in my head I thought they were the two best friends I had ever made. We were together for 3 whole years, adding up to well over 3000 hours in the same rooms with constant social interaction. The truth though was that we were not friends, in reality I abused both of them constantly.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b>Mostly it was emotional abuse</b>, I would cling to them all day and force them to act a certain way and force them to be nice to me and tell everyone we were all best friends. And in my head I truly believed it, I thought they were my two best friends, but the reality was that one of them really wanted nothing to do with me and couldn't find a way to tell me because of how manipulative I was and the other had been legitimately brainwashed by me into thinking I was also his friend but what I ended up doing to him was even worse by the end of 8th grade when things fell apart completely.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>There was physical abuse going on too but that mostly began in our 3rd year (8th grade) but it was just them telling me to stop doing something that I just kept doing so they lost their patience.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b><span style="font-size:larger;">While all this was happening, our behavior and understanding of what is "socially acceptable" went completely overboard after about a year as a result of the isolation from the rest of the school and the things I was doing to keep us together at all times.</span></b>
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>We created a <b>"secret language"</b> and began to use it every day for 2 years:
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span><b>Here is a chart:</b>
			</p>
			<div style="text-align:center;">

					</p>
					<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b>The word "Eagler" was part of this language</b>, it meant someone who eats eagle eggs and it was the funniest one in everyone's opinion
			</p>
			<br>
			<p style="text-align:center;">
				<a href="./Five Nights at Winston&#39;s - An Explanation_files/eagler_definition.png" target="_blank" class="nolink">

				</a>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>Then there were the noises we made, <b>'eeeeeeeeee'</b> started at the beginning of 7th grade because the kid I brainwashed had really bad ADHD and the math teacher was like "what's a rational number" and I heard the kid, who wasn't even paying attention because he was just in the back of the room, he made this "eeeEEEeeee" noise and me and the other kid were both sitting at a table together and heard it and thought it was funny.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b><span style="font-size:larger;">We started saying 'eeeeeeeeee' every single day every minute or so.</span></b>
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>Again, like the 'secret language', we took it way too far <b>(we kept it up the same whole 2 remaining years of school together)</b>, and truly did it on average once per minute minimum in any place we went.

<span class="tab"></span>As you can imagine though, <b>this was really bad for our mental and social health</b>, to keep this up all day without moderation for all those 100s of days we were stuck together.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b><span style="font-size:larger;">Everything I understood about what socially acceptable behavior looks like outside of that class got completely distorted, and when I got to high school it only took a week or two for everyone to decide I was insane and a pussy.</span></b>
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>I never was able to understand this though, my behavior kept getting worse and worse, I kept abusing my 'friends' in more and more severe ways and to everyone around me it was becoming clear that I was a sick person with legitimate mental problems.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b>Nothing was going my way anymore and I felt lost</b>. I didn't know how to fix things, I just wanted to go back in time to a year or so before 8th grade when I could still act completely retarded in the way I thought was funny with my two 'friends' but I hadn't let it destroy my entire identity and ability to connect with other people socially yet.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>It all led to more and more depression and frustration that I couldn't control, every day the minute nobody was around I'd just get a rush of emotions I couldn't control and it drove me crazy. I was having a complete mental breakdown.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b>Frustration, regret, anxiety, anger, depression</b>
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b><span style="font-size:larger;">And sadly, I eventually found a completely toxic solution to distract myself, and that solution was to use my time and energy to make <span style="border-bottom:2px dashed #BBBBBB;margin-bottom:-2px;">Five Nights at Winston's.</span></span> <span style="color:#AA0000;">(facepalm, terrible solution)</span></b>
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>The game is all one big coping mechanism I chose to use to distract myself to hide from the fallout of all my bad decisions, I used it to relive the times shortly before any of the consequences of my mistakes began to catch up with me. To relive the times where I had already passed the point of no return but before the problems it caused affected my quality of life in a way I couldn't keep out of my head.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>I modeled my whole school the way I had remembered it fondly, I re-created the janitor's office (we used to think it was hilarious to fuck with him) and filled the walls with pictures of different 'good' memories. I put fruit everywhere because we thought it was funny to go steal the left-over fruit from the cafeteria every day and throw it at stuff, as you can see in some pictures on the wall. I modeled the main characters after the funniest erasers I could find from my collection, I littered the school with small things to remind myself of random funny memories I had. I recorded phone calls with references in it to stuff me and my 'friends' did in the past that made me smile.

<span class="tab"></span><b>This was not fucking healthy</b>, getting hung up on the past to the point where I spent 2 months living in a fantasy world making this game to try and hold onto things that made me happy before I forget them is abnormal, but then knowing the reason was because I couldn't accept the person I had become as a result of all those things makes it highly toxic to me specifically.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>The way I had white-washed all the details to hide the blame and the fact that I never deserved the respect of any of the 'friends' that inspired most of this game is misleading. Their pictures are on the walls of the office you play in but the reality is that neither of them would ever ask me to do that or suggest it as an idea, I just went and did it only to make myself feel good when they would never want to do the same.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>Every day for two months I would come home from school freaking out and I'd go to my room and shut the door and work on this game and pretend my life was going great. The amount of time I spent working on this adds up to just under 500 hours of work on a project I did just to escape from my problems and the fact that I was being a bad person to everyone I knew.

<span class="tab"></span><b>You play as the janitor of my middle school in this game</b>. I mentioned earlier that we thought it was funny to mess with him but also the janitor's office is the only logical place I could think of as the location for the player, it's small and messy and there is a door on either side in the real life version so it was easy to base the game around.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>Here's a random recording of the guy I made accidentally in September 2021 when I was messing with radios, I saw a distant line on the spectrum analyzer at ~150 MHz and tuned to it and heard this:

			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>It's not very well labeled but here is the office's location on the map of the school:

<span class="tab"></span>The checks at the end of the game are written out to "Reed Colcaizer" who was a different kid outside of that class of 30 people I was stuck with who I also called my 'friend' even though he didn't really like me, but the check also (awkwardly) says "(actually you play as someone else)" which is referring to the fact that you actually play as Larry and I just didn't want to get in trouble by some teacher who gets the reference.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>The phone calls in the game just describe vandalism that the erasers did on the previous night, some is referring to times we made random messes and thought it was funny to imagine the janitor's reaction to seeing it but parts of it is random too.
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span><b>There's no real narrative to the fact there are erasers</b>, the best parallel I can draw between the erasers and real life was that in 7th grade I made dozens of erasers similar to them and put them all over the school high up where nobody could get them down and made them look like they are staring at everyone who walks by, but mostly I just chose them as characters because I thought it was funny
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="tab"></span>This part of the map refers to when we thought it was funny to smash fruit. It was in the same location shown on this map and there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;:&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;face looking at it:

<span class="tab"></span>One was a counselor that we'd always do a sort of "red light, green light" sort of thing with where we'd hide on the blacktop and every time his back we turned we fucked something up a little more and watched him do a double-take when he turned around:

<span class="tab"></span>20 * 90 = 1800 minutes = <b>30 hours</b> of rendering cameras, and I sat and watched each render so I could save it when it completed and then reposition the characters to render the next one.

<span class="tab"></span><b>No FNAF game I have ever seen, even the ones also made in Clickteam Fusion, have correctly figured this detail out which is stupid because it is an iconic detail to the graphics of the original FNAF.</b>

<span class="tab"></span>No sound effects in this game were stolen from FNAF, every sound effect used in FNAF can be found in libraries on <b><a href="https://www.sounddogs.com/" target="_blank">www.sounddogs.com</a></b> published by actual sound design studios. Scott Cawthon downloaded all his sound effects and music from this site, he only actually recorded his own phone calls in FNAF otherwise he doesn't own the rights to any of the audio in the game.

<span class="tab"></span>Two of the metal sound effects I downloaded and used in the boiler room to the right of the office can be heard in an episode in a later season of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Trailer+Park+Boys" target="_blank">Trailer Park Boys</a> when Ricky is working on his car. The editors of the show coincidentally downloaded the same metal sound effects as I did off sounddogs when they edited that episode.

<span class="tab"></span>The real FNAF font was also found on a forum (It is called "LCD Solid") where it was posted years before FNAF came out so that's not stolen from the game either.

<span class="tab"></span>Pretty much the only graphic I did steal from FNAF was the camera static animation, I couldn't find one that looked better than FNAF so I was just like "fuck it I'll just steal it, it's literally the only thing I'm gonna steal so who cares"
